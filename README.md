# filter_tfs

This package enables you to filter [tf2](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2) transform frames in ROS.
Currently, an exponential filter, for both the translation and rotation (using spherical linear interpolation) parts, is implemented.

# Support

Currently, only ROS noetic is supported.
For ROS 2, see an older version [here](https://github.com/cmower/filter_tf).
